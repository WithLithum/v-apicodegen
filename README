This is the API code generator for my project WithLithum.Core series.

To use this, simply build this repository, and then you'd just execute the
output repo with the only parameter of what namespace you want to generate,
like this (beware of that's case sensitive):

	./WithLithum.ApiCodeGen PED

If there is any thing you need to fix (like pointers), you'll get the following
message:

	Warning: Native with hash (hash) needs your attention.

The "(hash)" should be a hash of the native. You can just simply copy that hash
and then Ctrl+F in VS or whether your editor is, and you'll get to whatever
that native is.

Note that natives with Any parameter / return values are automatically
generated as object type. You might want to fix that.
